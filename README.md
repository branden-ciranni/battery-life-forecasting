# Forecasting Battery Life

Forecasting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) using NASA Li-Ion Battery Dataset

### Currently Implemented
- `src/utils/read_nasa.py`: parse and read `.mat` files containing battery data (Usage Documented in File)

### To be Implemented when I find the time...
- Predict RUL for batteries based on this data.
